<h3>What is ScamShield?</h3>
<p>ScamShield is a product suite that defends against scams, and was developed
by Open Government Products in collaboration with the Singapore Police
Force (SPF) and the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC).</p>
<p>With the soft launch of the ScamShield Bot, now ScamShield users can check
and report scams on the Bot and protect themselves from scam calls and
SMSes through the Apps.</p>
<h3>The ScamShield Defense System</h3>
<p>The ScamShield Bot comes as the latest anti-scam product to help users
identify and report scams. Therefore, to get protection from scam SMSes
and calls, use the ScamShield App in conjunction with reporting and checking
scams on the Bot to receive more protective benefits from ScamShield’s
overall defense system.</p>
<h4>App Features</h4>

<h3>How ScamShield works</h3>
<p>The ScamShield defense system works better when more scam reports with
sufficient information are submitted. Whether through the Bot or the Apps,
all reports received through ScamShield are reviewed by the Singapore Police
Force (SPF). Hence, ScamShield is the authoritative way to check whether
something is a scam.</p>
<p><strong>How the Bot works:</strong>
</p>
<p>When checking whether a message or call is scam, the ScamShield Bot will
be able to tell whether the info being checked has previously been reported,
whether any of the contacts have been confirmed as scam by the SPF, or
whether the machine learning classifier detects any suspicious web links
or messages that have previously been used by scammers.</p>
<p>The contacts determined to be scam by the SPF will then be blacklisted,
and SMSes or calls from these numbers will be flagged or blocked on devices
with the official ScamShield App. Thus, by reporting to the ScamShield
Bot or the Apps, you’ll be helping to protect the broader community in
Singapore from similar scams.</p>
<p><strong>How the Apps work:</strong>
</p>
<p>The ScamShield App detects incoming scam calls and text messages. Incoming
calls from unknown numbers are checked against a database maintained by
the Singapore Police Force – if ScamShield determines the number has been
used for scams, it will be blocked.</p>
<p>For incoming SMSes from anyone who isn’t a saved contact, ScamShield will
determine if the SMS is a scam using an on-device algorithm. For the iOS
version, it filters these scam SMSes into the Junk folder. For Android,
a notification is sent to alert users that they may have received a scam
message.</p>
<p>Detected and reported scam messages and calls are sent to SPF for review.
This keeps the App updated and will help protect others from similar scam
messages and calls.</p>
<h3>Your privacy is our priority</h3>
<p>We value your privacy and protect your data with utmost care. The ScamShield
Bot and Apps follow strict security measures to keep your information safe
and confidential. The Bot cannot read your other chats on WhatsApp, and
the Apps cannot read any SMSes coming from saved contacts.</p>
<p>When you submit a report to the ScamShield Bot or the Apps, the SPF will
only be able to see the information you have submitted.</p>
