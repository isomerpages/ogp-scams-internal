<h4>IMDA's international call &amp; SMS blocking feature</h4>
<p>IMDA’s anti-scam measures are developed to disrupt scam operations across
various communications channels via a multi-layered approach. IMDA has
partnered with Telcos to implement anti-scam measures that strengthen safeguards
for SMS and calls to Singapore users.</p>
<p>From January to September 2023, more than 300 million scam calls were
blocked by our Telcos. This translates to approximately one in every four
incoming calls from international numbers blocked for this period. All
remaining calls from international numbers are tagged with the “+” prefix
to remind the public to be vigilant when answering such calls. To further
protect users who do not wish to receive calls from international numbers,
Telcos are now introducing the option for subscribers to block such incoming
calls on their mobile phones. This service is available from 5 January
2024 onwards.</p>
