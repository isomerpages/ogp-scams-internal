as they may be indicative of fraudulent activity.</p>

<p><strong>How to Shop Safely on E-commerce Sites</strong>
<br>Shopping online offers convenience and a wide range of products, but it's
important to take measures to ensure a safe and secure shopping experience.
Here are some key measures to consider when shopping on e-commerce sites:
<br>2. Keep Software Updated</p>
<p>Regularly update your device's operating system, web browser, and antivirus
software to protect against security vulnerabilities and malware.
<br><strong>3. Use Strong Passwords</strong>
</p>
<p>Create strong, unique passwords for your e-commerce accounts and consider
using a password manager to securely store and manage your passwords.
<br><strong>4. Beware of Phishing Attempts</strong>
</p>
<p>Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or pop-up ads requesting
personal or financial information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and
only provide sensitive information on trusted websites.</p>
<h2><strong>E-commerce Marketplace Transaction Safety Ratings</strong></h2>
<p>E-commerce scams are one of the top scam types in Singapore. In 2021,
there were more than 2,700 number of cases reported, with about $5.8million

Safety Ratings (TSR) is introduced.</p>

<h3><strong>Lower your bank transaction limits </strong></h3>
<p>Falling prey to scammers due to unsafe banking practices can have significant
repercussions, including financial loss, identity theft, and emotional
distress, jeopardizing hard-earned money and financial stability. It can
lead to unauthorized transactions, compromised personal information, and
a loss of trust in financial institutions. Prioritizing safe banking practices
is essential to mitigate these risks and safeguard personal and financial
well-being.</p>
<p>Add ScamShield App and security features (e.g. enable Two-Factor Authentication
(2FA), Multifactor Authentication for banks and set up transaction limits
for internet banking transactions, including PayNow).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether
on a website or to callers over the phone. Personal information and bank
details such as internet bank account usernames, passwords, OTP codes from
tokens, are useful to criminals.</p>

<h3><strong>Adjust CPF withdrawal limit</strong></h3>
<p>A default online CPF withdrawal limit of $2,000 a day will be applied
to all CPF members aged 55 and above. &nbsp;This default daily limit can
be adjusted to any amount, including $0 and up to $200,000, at any time
online. Any increases to the daily withdrawal limit however, will be subject
to Singpass Face Verification (SFV) and a 12-hour cooling period to prevent
unauthorised adjustments.</p>
<p>Introducing a default daily limit for online CPF withdrawals is part of
CPF Boardâ€™s ongoing efforts to safeguard CPF savings against fraudulent
withdrawals online. This is on top of our existing precautionary measures,
which include SFV as a step-up authentication challenge for certain CPF
e-services. In addition, CPF members can be assured that their CPF savings
can only be paid to bank accounts that are verified as belonging to them.&nbsp;
They will also be notified immediately of any CPF withdrawals.</p>
