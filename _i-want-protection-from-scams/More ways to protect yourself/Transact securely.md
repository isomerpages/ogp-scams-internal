<h3><strong>Be wary when shopping on e-commerce sites</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When making online purchases, check the reviews of the seller, and look
out for potential tell-tale signs of scams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always pay using the secured payment options offered by the platforms.
Do not take transactions off-platform, especially when making payment.
A common scam tactic is to lure victims to messaging platforms such as
WhatsApp or Telegram, and direct victims to make banks transfers for items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be wary of deals that seem too good to be true. Exercise caution when
encountering heavily discounted or unrealistic deals, as they may be indicative
of fraudulent activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the safety ratings of e-commerce platforms by referring to the
<a href="https://www.mha.gov.sg/e-commerce-marketplace-transaction-safety-ratings" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">E-commerce Marketplace Transaction Safety Ratings (TSR)</a>

<h3><strong>Safeguard banking details and lower transaction limits</strong></h3>
<p>Falling prey to scammers can have significant repercussions, including
financial loss, identity theft, and emotional distress, jeopardizing hard-earned
money and financial stability. Prioritizing safe banking practices is essential
to mitigate these risks and safeguard personal and financial well-being.
Some ways to do so include lowering your bank transaction limits, setting
a low threshold for funds transfer transaction notifications, including
for PayNow, and staying alert to all transaction notifications so that
any unauthorised payments are reported as soon as possible to increase
the chances of recovery.</p>
<h3><strong>Adopting good digital banking hygiene practices</strong></h3>
<p>Add ScamShield App and security features (e.g. enable Two-Factor Authentication
(2FA), Multifactor Authentication for banks).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details (such as
your internet bank account usernames, passwords, OTP codes from tokens),
whether on a website or to callers over the phone.</p>
<p>Activate the emergency self-service “kill switch” to suspend your bank
account quickly if you suspect that your bank account has been compromised.</p>

<h3><strong>Adjust CPF withdrawal limit</strong></h3>
<p>A default online CPF withdrawal limit of $2,000 a day will be applied
to all CPF members aged 55 and above. &nbsp;This default daily limit can
be adjusted to any amount, including $0 and up to $200,000, at any time
online. Any increases to the daily withdrawal limit however, will be subject
to Singpass Face Verification (SFV) and a 12-hour cooling period to prevent
unauthorised adjustments.</p>
<p>Introducing a default daily limit for online CPF withdrawals is part of
CPF Board’s ongoing efforts to safeguard CPF savings against fraudulent
withdrawals online. This is on top of our existing precautionary measures,
which include SFV as a step-up authentication challenge for certain CPF
e-services. In addition, CPF members can be assured that their CPF savings
can only be paid to bank accounts that are verified as belonging to them.&nbsp;
They will also be notified immediately of any CPF withdrawals.</p>
