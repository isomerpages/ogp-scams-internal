<h4><strong>Use anti-virus software</strong></h4>
<p>Viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware (i.e., malicious
software) can infect your devices and cause your devices to slow down or
malfunction. Cybercriminals can also deploy malware to corrupt files, steal
data, and even gain access to your social media and bank accounts.
<br>We have seen many cases where victims lost large amounts of money due
to unauthorised bank account withdrawals on mobile devices infected with
malware.&nbsp;
<br>Anti-virus apps which can detect malware and malicious phishing links
are also key to safeguarding your devices and accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure which security app to download? CSA has put together a list of
recommended apps which users can download to suit their needs and budget.
The apps come in free and paid versions, offering a range of features such
as malicious URL blocking and malware scanning.</p>
<p>But remember – there is no 100% protection and it is important to remain
vigilant and adopt good cyber hygiene habits to protect your devices.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>How to Choose an Anti-Virus App</strong></h4>
<p>It is important to note that anti-virus apps from different brands have
varying functions and capabilities. Below are some factors to consider
and steps to take when choosing an anti-virus app:</p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<h4><br><strong>Always only download from official App Stores</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not download apps from unknown or unofficial sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only use app stores such as Google Play Store (Android) or Apple App Store
(iOS), as these platforms have measures in place to detect and remove malicious
apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For apps that do not have an automatic update function, do update your
apps promptly when you receive a notification to do so. This will ensure
that you will have the most up-to-date protection against cyber threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the developer’s reputation, number of downloads and app reviews
before downloading their apps. Stick to well-known developers where possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never download files or applications from unknown sources, and never click
on pop-up advertisements, suspicious links, or open files or email attachments
from unknown senders. Otherwise, you may unknowingly download malware into
your computers or mobile devices.</p>
</li>

<h4><strong>Verify Application Permissions</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When installing an app, review and grant the necessary permissions relevant
to the app’s functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be cautious if the app asks for excessive or unrelated permissions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Consider Apps with Malware </strong></h4>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Removal Capabilities&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>While many apps provide basic malware detection, malware removal often
remains a separate feature. Many free options can only detect and quarantine
malware, but may not offer removal options if your devices are found to
be infected.</p>
<p>CSA conducted tests on the malware and phishing detection capabilities
of these apps in August this year. The methodology involved installing
the anti-virus app on a device and infecting the device with recent malware
variants to test if the app was able to detect them. Similarly, the device
was also used to access selected phishing websites to test if the anti-virus
app detected them.&nbsp;</p>
