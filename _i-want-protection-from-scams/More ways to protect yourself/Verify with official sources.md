<p>Before you click any links or act on information that you are unsure of,
always check with the official source for legitimacy.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For investment-related situations, check with official sources such as
the Financial Institutions Directory, Register of Representatives, and
Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Investor Alert List, to verify the legitimacy
of the investment offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For property-related situations, check the <a href="https://www.cea.gov.sg/aceas/public-register/ea/1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) Public Register</a> to
verify that the person you are liaising with is a registered property agent.
In addition, do not transfer money for rental units until you have viewed
the unit in person. It is likely a scam if a deposit is requested even
before you have viewed the unit in person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For job-related situations, check the company’s official website or contact
the company directly to verify the legitimacy of the job offer.</p>

</ul>
