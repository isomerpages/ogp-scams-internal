<h1><strong>How to Shop Safely on E-commerce Sites</strong></h1>
<p>Shopping online offers convenience and a wide range of products, but it's
important to take measures to ensure a safe and secure shopping experience.
Here are some key measures to consider when shopping on e-commerce sites:</p>
<p><strong>1. Use Secure and Trusted Websites</strong>
</p>
<p>Ensure that you shop on secure and reputable e-commerce websites. Look
for "https://" in the website's URL and a padlock symbol in the address
bar, indicating a secure connection.</p>
<p><strong>2. Keep Software Updated</strong>
</p>
<p>Regularly update your device's operating system, web browser, and antivirus
software to protect against security vulnerabilities and malware.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Strong Passwords</strong>
</p>
<p>Create strong, unique passwords for your e-commerce accounts and consider
using a password manager to securely store and manage your passwords.</p>
<p><strong>4. Beware of Phishing Attempts</strong>
</p>
<p>Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or pop-up ads requesting
personal or financial information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and
only provide sensitive information on trusted websites.</p>
<p><strong>5. Review Seller and Product Information</strong>
</p>
<p>Before making a purchase, research the seller's reputation and read product
reviews. Verify the seller's contact information and return policy.</p>
<p><strong>6. Use Secure Payment Methods</strong>
</p>
<p>Opt for secure payment methods such as credit cards or digital wallets
that offer buyer protection. Avoid sharing sensitive financial information
through email or unsecured websites.</p>
<p><strong>7. Monitor Financial Statements</strong>
</p>
<p>Regularly review your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized
transactions. Report any suspicious activity to your financial institution
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>8. Protect Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>Limit the amount of personal information shared online and be cautious
when providing details such as your address, phone number, or social security
number.</p>
<p><strong>9. Enable Two-Factor Authentication</strong>
</p>
<p>Where available, enable two-factor authentication for your e-commerce
accounts to add an extra layer of security.</p>
<p><strong>10. Be Wary of Deals That Seem Too Good to Be True</strong>
</p>
<p>Exercise caution when encountering heavily discounted or unrealistic deals,
as they may be indicative of fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>By following these measures, you can enhance your safety and security
while shopping on e-commerce sites. Remember to trust your instincts and
prioritize caution when navigating the online shopping landscape.</p>

<p>Falling prey to scammers due to unsafe banking practices can have significant
repercussions, including financial loss, identity theft, and emotional
distress, jeopardizing hard-earned money and financial stability. It can
lead to unauthorized transactions, compromised personal information, and
a loss of trust in financial institutions. Prioritizing safe banking practices
is essential to mitigate these risks and safeguard personal and financial
well-being.</p>
<h3><strong>Banking Safe</strong></h3>
<p>Add ScamShield App and security features (e.g. enable Two-Factor Authentication
(2FA), Multifactor Authentication for banks and set up transaction limits
for internet banking transactions, including PayNow).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether
on a website or to callers over the phone. Personal information and bank
details such as internet bank account usernames, passwords, OTP codes from
tokens, are useful to criminals.</p>

<h3><strong>CPF Withdrawal Limit</strong></h3>
<p>A default online CPF withdrawal limit of $2,000 a day will be applied
to all CPF members aged 55 and above. &nbsp;This default daily limit can
be adjusted to any amount, including $0 and up to $200,000, at any time
online. Any increases to the daily withdrawal limit however, will be subject
to Singpass Face Verification (SFV) and a 12-hour cooling period to prevent
unauthorised adjustments.</p>
<p>Introducing a default daily limit for online CPF withdrawals is part of
CPF Boardâ€™s ongoing efforts to safeguard CPF savings against fraudulent
withdrawals online. This is on top of our existing precautionary measures,
which include SFV as a step-up authentication challenge for certain CPF
e-services. In addition, CPF members can be assured that their CPF savings
can only be paid to bank accounts that are verified as belonging to them.&nbsp;
They will also be notified immediately of any CPF withdrawals.</p>
