<p>Falling prey to scammers due to unsafe banking practices can have significant
repercussions, including financial loss, identity theft, and emotional
distress, jeopardizing hard-earned money and financial stability. It can
lead to unauthorized transactions, compromised personal information, and
a loss of trust in financial institutions. Prioritizing safe banking practices
is essential to mitigate these risks and safeguard personal and financial
well-being.</p>
<h3><strong>Banking Safe</strong></h3>
<p>Add ScamShield App and security features (e.g. enable Two-Factor Authentication
(2FA), Multifactor Authentication for banks and set up transaction limits
for internet banking transactions, including PayNow).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether
on a website or to callers over the phone. Personal information and bank
details such as internet bank account usernames, passwords, OTP codes from
tokens, are useful to criminals.</p>

<h3><strong>CPF Withdrawal Limit</strong></h3>
<p>A default online CPF withdrawal limit of $2,000 a day will be applied
to all CPF members aged 55 and above. &nbsp;This default daily limit can
be adjusted to any amount, including $0 and up to $200,000, at any time
online. Any increases to the daily withdrawal limit however, will be subject
to Singpass Face Verification (SFV) and a 12-hour cooling period to prevent
unauthorised adjustments.</p>
<p>Introducing a default daily limit for online CPF withdrawals is part of
CPF Boardâ€™s ongoing efforts to safeguard CPF savings against fraudulent
withdrawals online. This is on top of our existing precautionary measures,
which include SFV as a step-up authentication challenge for certain CPF
e-services. In addition, CPF members can be assured that their CPF savings
can only be paid to bank accounts that are verified as belonging to them.&nbsp;
They will also be notified immediately of any CPF withdrawals.</p>
