<h2><strong>What is a scam?</strong></h2>
<p>Not all negative experiences are scams. A scam is designed to trick you
into giving away your money, personal details or data by offering an attractive
deal or false information.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Perpetrators would establish links with potential victims via various
communication channels, such as via phone calls, WhatsApp messages, SMSes,
social media and e-commerce platforms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perpetrators would target victims who unwittingly respond to their outreach
and deceive the victims, resulting in victims losing something of value
to the perpetrators (usually transferring of money or virtual credits,
or revealing personal particulars or credentials)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is usually no face-to-face meeting between perpetrators and their
victims throughout the entire engagement process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Common signs of scams</strong></h2>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Unexpected Contact</strong> 
<br>If someone contacts you out of the blue, be cautious. Scammers often reach
out without you asking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feeling Rushed</strong> 
<br>If you feel pressured to act quickly, it could be a scam. Scammers often
want you to make decisions in a hurry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asking for Personal Info</strong> 
<br>Be careful if someone asks for your personal or financial details, like
passwords or credit card numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Offers That Sound Too Good</strong> 
<br>If an offer sounds too good to be true, it might be a scam. Scammers often
promise amazing benefits or profits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Investment Offers</strong> 
<br>If someone you don't know offers you an investment opportunity, be wary.
It could be a scam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unverified Sources</strong> 
<br>If you can't verify the person or website, be cautious. Scammers often
use untrustworthy sources to trick people.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why you should ACT</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Everyone is vulnerable and anyone can fall prey to scams</strong>.
As scams are always evolving, we may not always be vigilant to scams.</p>
<p>ACT encourages indviduals to take preventive actions to protect themselves
and their loved ones against scams.</p>
<p><strong>ADD</strong> ScamShield app and security features.</p>
<p><strong>CHECK </strong>for scam signs and with official sources.</p>
<p><strong>TELL</strong> authorities, family and friends.</p>

<p>Minister of State Sun Xueling launched the “<strong>I can ACT against scams</strong>”
national anti-scam campaign during the “SCAMINAR! ACT Against Scams” on
18 January 2023. The national campaign aims to educate and encourage members
of the public to translate scam awareness into action by proactively adopting
anti-scam measures.</p>
<h2><strong>Anyone can fall prey to scams.</strong></h2>
<p>Victims come from all demographic groups and backgrounds. Scam tactics
constantly evolve and scammers use persuasive tactics to prey on common
human vulnerabilities. However, there are preventive actions you can take,
to protect you and your loved ones against scams.</p>
<p>The ACT (“Add, Check, Tell”) framework outlines three key actions to improve
your defences against scams.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><strong>“ADD”</strong> stands for adding the ScamShield app and security features.</h2>
<p>The ScamShield app helps to block scam calls and filter or flag scam SMSes.
With ScamShield, you can expect to receive reduced numbers of scam calls.
You can also expect fewer malicious SMSes, such as those offering fake
job offers and loans, or tricking you to click malicious links.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Install anti-virus apps to prevent malware. Anti-virus apps which
can detect malware and malicious phishing links are key to safeguarding
your devices and accounts. CSA has put together a list of recommended apps
which users can download to suit their needs and budget - <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/our-programmes/cybersecurity-outreach/cybersecurity-campaigns/the-unseen-enemy-campaign/add-scamshield-and-anti-virus-apps" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Add ScamShield and Anti-Virus Apps</a>.
Refer to the infographics below on the tell-tale signs of a malware infection
and what to do if your device is infected.</p>
<p>Other effective security features/practices you can adopt include the
following:</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable two-factor or multi-factor authentication
and use strong passphrases for your personal banking, Singpass and social
media accounts.</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable privacy settings for your social
media and messaging accounts. Refer to infographics below to secure your
WhatsApp and Telegram accounts.</p>
<p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lower your bank transaction limits,
to limit the potential losses to scams.</p>
<p>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To guard against malware, you should
regularly update your devices’ operating systems and mobile applications
with the latest security patches.</p>
<p>v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjust CPF daily withdrawal limit to
safeguard CPF savings against fraudulent withdrawals online. Default is
now set at $2,000 a day.</p>

</div>
<h2><strong>“CHECK”</strong> stands for checking for scam signs.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you receive a phone
call or message asking for your personal information, banking credentials,
or to transfer money, always check and verify.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, check with the organization involved.
For example, if the caller/sender claims to be from a bank, call the official
hotline of the bank to verify.</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the caller/sender claims to be a
Government official, check with the said agency directly.</p>
<p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the message appears to be sent by
a delivery company, and you are expecting a delivery, check with the delivery
company directly.</p>
<p>Government agencies and banks will never send you messages with Uniform
Resource Locator to request for your personal information or banking credentials.
If in doubt, do not click on such links. Government agencies will also
not ask for your personal particulars or banking credentials over the phone,
via SMSes, or emails.</p>
<p>When downloading and installing applications, always download only from
the official application stores (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple App Store).</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the developer’s information on
the application listing to confirm it is the official developer. Check
the number of downloads and user reviews to ensure that it is a reputable
application before proceeding with the download.</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never download files or applications
from unknown sources, and never click on pop-up advertisements, suspicious
links, or open files or email attachments from unknown senders. Otherwise,
you may unknowingly download malware into your computers or mobile devices.</p>
<p>When making online purchases, check the reviews of the seller, and look
out for potential tell-tale signs of scams</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always pay using the secured payment
options offered by the platforms. Do not take transactions off-platform,
especially when making payment. A common scam tactic is to lure victims
to messaging platforms such as WhatsApp or Telegram, and direct victims
to make banks transfers for items.</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the safety ratings of e-commerce
platforms by referring to the <a href="https://www.mha.gov.sg/e-commerce-marketplace-transaction-safety-ratings" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">E-commerce Marketplace Transaction Safety Ratings (TSR)</a>
</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common scam signs include the following
(not exhaustive):</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attractive offers presented on messaging,
e-commerce or social media platforms. The offers are often unrealistic,
and can be in the form of e-commerce, loans, investments and job offers.</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requests for transfer of money to bank
accounts made via phone calls, social media and/or messaging platforms.
This includes request for urgent money transfers for fake emergencies,
fake friend calls, fake government officials, or for limited e-commerce
flash deals.</p>
<p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requests to click on unverified links
or download application provided via social media/messaging platforms.</p>
<p>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requests for personal details such as
NRIC, Singpass, bank account details and one-time passwords (OTPs).</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do
not allow others to use your Singpass and/or bank accounts. Our bank accounts
and Singpass accounts are for our own use. It is illegal to share them
as your accounts may be used to facilitate scams or other crimes. Penalties
for abuse of Singpass and bank accounts are severe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Official sources you could
check with include the following:</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check your potential scam encounter (e.g.,
suspicious call or message) with the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/scamshield-bot" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield Bot</a>. The Bot also
enables you to conveniently share your scam encounters with the Singapore
Police Force. By doing so, you will be helping to protect our community
against scams.</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check your potential scam encounter
by calling the National Crime Prevention Council’s (NCPC) Anti-Scam Helpline
at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1800-722-6688 </a>(Mon-Fri,
9 am-5pm, excl. PH).</p>
<p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For investment-related situations,
check with official sources such as the Financial Institutions Directory,
Register of Representatives, and Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Investor
Alert List, to verify the legitimacy of the investment offer.</p>
<p>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For property-related situations, check
the <a href="https://www.cea.gov.sg/aceas/public-register/ea/1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) Public Register</a> to
verify that the person you are liaising with is a registered property agent.
In addition, do not transfer money for rental units until you have viewed
the unit in person. It is likely a scam if a deposit is requested even
before you have viewed the unit in person.</p>
<p>v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For job-related situations, check the
company’s official website or contact the company directly to verify the
legitimacy of the job offer.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slow down and check yourself: Scammers
often leverage on strong emotions created by their tactics and these emotions
can cause you to lower your guard. They also create situations that impose
a sense of urgency, do not give you time to think and pressure you to make
quick decisions. If you find that you are uncertain, emotional (e.g., fearful,
excited) or pressured by an approach/offer from a stranger, do slow down,
take a moment to calm down and think carefully about the situation. Review
the situation for scam signs. Speak to someone you trust about the situation
or check with official sources before making any decision.</p>

</div>
<h2><strong>“Tell”</strong> stands for telling authorities, family and friends about scams.</h2>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you suspect that you have fallen
prey to scams, call your bank or use bank’s mobile application immediately
and activate the emergency “kill-switch”. This is a feature that the banks
can suspend your account immediately to prevent your money from being transferred
away by scammers.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should also file a police report
immediately. You may <a href="https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/homepage/police-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">file an e-report online</a>,
or in person at the nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre or Neighbourhood
Police Post.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also share your scam encounters
via the ScamShield app and/or to the ScamShield Bot. Your sharing can help
prevent other potential victims from falling prey.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell your family and friends about
the latest scam trends. You can prevent them from falling prey to scams
by doing so.</p>
