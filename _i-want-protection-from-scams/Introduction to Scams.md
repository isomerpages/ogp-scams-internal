<h3><strong>What is a scam?</strong></h3>
<p>A scam is designed to trick you into giving away your money, personal
details or data by offering an attractive deal or false information.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Perpetrators would establish links with potential victims via various
communication channels, such as via phone calls, WhatsApp messages, SMSes,
social media and e-commerce platforms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perpetrators would target victims who unwittingly respond to their outreach
and deceive the victims, resulting in victims losing something of value
to the perpetrators (usually transferring of money or virtual credits,
or revealing personal particulars or credentials)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is usually no face-to-face meeting between perpetrators and their
victims throughout the entire engagement process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Common signs of scams</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Unexpected Contact</strong>: If someone contacts you out of the
blue, be cautious. Scammers often reach out without you asking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feeling Rushed</strong>: If you feel pressured to act quickly,
it could be a scam. Scammers often want you to make decisions in a hurry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asking for Personal Info</strong>: Be careful if someone asks
for your personal or financial details, like passwords or credit card numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Offers That Sound Too Good</strong>: If an offer sounds too good
to be true, it might be a scam. Scammers often promise amazing benefits
or profits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Investment Offers</strong>: If someone you don't know
offers you an investment opportunity, be wary. It could be a scam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unverified Sources</strong>: If you can't verify the person or
website, be cautious. Scammers often use untrustworthy sources to trick
people.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Anyone can fall prey to scams</strong></h3>
<p>Victims come from all demographic groups and backgrounds. Scam tactics
constantly evolve and scammers use persuasive tactics to prey on common
human vulnerabilities. However, there are preventive actions you can take,
to protect you and your loved ones against scams. The ACT (“Add, Check,
Tell”) framework outlines three key actions to improve your defences against
scams.</p>

<h3><strong>CHECK</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;When you receive a phone call or message asking for your personal
information, banking credentials, or to transfer money, always check and
verify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, check with the organization involved. For example, if the caller/sender
claims to be from a bank, call the official hotline of the bank to verify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the caller/sender claims to be a Government official, check with the
said agency directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the message appears to be sent by a delivery company, and you are expecting
a delivery, check with the delivery company directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government agencies and banks will never send you messages with Uniform
Resource Locator to request for your personal information or banking credentials.
If in doubt, do not click on such links. Government agencies will also
not ask for your personal particulars or banking credentials over the phone,
via SMSes, or emails.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>TELL</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If you suspect that you have fallen prey to scams, call your bank or use
bank’s mobile application immediately and activate the emergency “kill-switch”.
This is a feature that the banks can suspend your account immediately to
prevent your money from being transferred away by scammers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should also file a police report immediately. You may <a href="https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/homepage/police-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">file an e-report online</a>,
or in person at the nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre or Neighbourhood
Police Post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also share your scam encounters via the ScamShield app and/or
to the ScamShield Bot. Your sharing can help prevent other potential victims
from falling prey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your family and friends about the latest scam trends. You can prevent
them from falling prey to scams by doing so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
