<p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For investment-related situations,
check with official sources such as the Financial Institutions Directory,
Register of Representatives, and Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Investor
Alert List, to verify the legitimacy of the investment offer.</p>
<p>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For property-related situations, check
the <a href="https://www.cea.gov.sg/aceas/public-register/ea/1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) Public Register</a> to
verify that the person you are liaising with is a registered property agent.
In addition, do not transfer money for rental units until you have viewed
the unit in person. It is likely a scam if a deposit is requested even
before you have viewed the unit in person.</p>
<p>v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For job-related situations, check the
company’s official website or contact the company directly to verify the
legitimacy of the job offer.</p>
