<h4>Should you fall prey to a scam (i.e., suffer monetary loss or loss of personal information), take the following steps to protect yourself from further losses, and prevent other victims from being scammed.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Contact your bank immediately</strong> if
your bank account or credit card has been compromised, so that the bank
can take immediate actions to prevent further monetary loss.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>File a police report online</strong> via
<a href="https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/homepage/police-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Police Report</a>, or in person at the nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre
or Neighbourhood Police Post. Call 999 if you require the Police’s urgent
assistance. If you have information about scams, you may share the information
with the Police via the Police Hotline at 1800-255-0000 or online via the
I-Witness e-Service (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.police.gov.sg/I-witness</a>).
&nbsp;</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your online account (e.g., email
or social media) is compromised, <strong>notify all your contacts</strong>,
and <strong>report the incident</strong> to the respective email service
provider or social media platform.&nbsp; If you still have access to your
account, <strong>change your passphrase immediately</strong>. <strong>Set up two-factor or multi-factor authentication</strong> if
you have not done so earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For e-commerce related scams,
in addition to making a police report, do also <strong>report the incident to the platform administrators</strong>.
This is to allow the platform to take down the fraudulent seller’s account
as soon as possible. Provide as much information as you can in the police
report such as scammers’ WhatsApp numbers and account details, information
and screenshots of the fraudulent posts (e.g., Instagram/Facebook/TikTok
advertisements or listings / Instagram stories).</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Be alert</strong> for scammers’
repeat advances. Some scammers are known to take advantage of their victims’
vulnerabilities. <strong>They may impersonate police officers or other authorities</strong> and
approach their victims with the intention of scamming their victims again.</p>
